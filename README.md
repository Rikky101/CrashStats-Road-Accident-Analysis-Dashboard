# Road-Accident-Analysis
## Introduction and Objectives
The primary objective of this data project was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to road accidents for the years 2021 and 2022. The client requested a comprehensive dashboard that highlights the following insights: Total Casualties, Monthly trends of casualties, Distribution of total casualties by road surface and road type.
The dashboard aims to support data-driven decision-making by presenting the insights in a clear, interactive, and visually appealing format.

## Tool Used: Excel

## Data Transformation
Data transformation was a crucial step to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the insights. The following transformations were performed:
1.	The raw dataset [Raw_Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bufASz-oRdBRBNBCQ-tS6V884PrykbxA/view?usp=drive_link) was converted into a structured table to facilitate easier manipulation and analysis.
2.	Each column was thoroughly scanned for inconsistencies. During this process, an inconsistency was detected in the "accident_severity" column where the term "fetal" was mistakenly used instead of "fatal". The inconsistency was corrected to maintain data integrity.
3.	Addition of New Columns:
   
    i.	Month of the Year was extracted from the date column using the text function to enable monthly trend analysis.

    ii.	Year was similarly extracted to differentiate between the two years under review.

## Visualization
Dynamic visuals, including line graphs, donut charts and comparative bar charts, were used to create a dashboard to convey information intuitively.

## Conclusion
The Road Accident Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022, helping stakeholders identify critical patterns and trends in casualty rates. The majority of casualties were classified as slight (84%), with cars accounting for 80% of incidents. Single carriageways and dry surfaces posed the highest risks, while rural areas recorded more casualties than urban areas.  Daylight accidents were significantly more common, suggesting factors beyond visibility play a major role.
